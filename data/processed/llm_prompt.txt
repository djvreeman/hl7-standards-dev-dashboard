# HL7 International Financial Analysis Request

## Organization Context
HL7 International is a non-profit organization focused on healthcare interoperability standards. 

### Key Organizational Changes:

- **2022**: Major restructuring - created two divisions (Standards Development and Standards Implementation) and hired three executives: Daniel Vreeman (Chief Standards Development Officer), Viet Nguyen (Chief Standards Implementation Officer), and Diego Kaminker (Deputy Chief Standards Implementation Officer)
- **2023**: Purchased AMG LLC, which significantly impacted their financial structure as AMG staff became HL7 employees

## Key Context for Analysis

### Major Business Model Change (April 2013)
- **Critical Context**: In April 2013, HL7 made a fundamental change to its business model by making all standards freely available to everyone, not just members
- **Revenue Impact**: This change likely had significant impact on membership value proposition and revenue streams
- **Analysis Consideration**: When analyzing pre-2013 vs post-2013 data, consider how this change affected membership growth, retention, and alternative revenue development
- **Strategic Context**: This change aligns with HL7's current 2025+ strategic vision for revenue diversification, as it represents an early move away from membership-dependent access models

### AMG LLC Acquisition Impact (2023-2024)
- In 2023, HL7 purchased AMG LLC for $3.3M in management services expenses
- In 2024, AMG staff became HL7 employees, shifting from external management services to internal salaries
- This structural change affects year-over-year comparisons
- **Compensation Structure Impact**: The acquisition expanded the "Officers, Directors, Trustees, Key Employees & Highest Compensated Employees" category as former AMG executives and key personnel were integrated into HL7's leadership structure
- **Growth Factors**: Recent increases in this compensation category reflect both executive pay growth and the addition of more senior roles from the AMG acquisition

### Additional Operating Cost Factors (2023-2024)
- **Financial Management Services**: HL7 brought on outside financial management services including a CFO/controller and 1.5 FTE accountant staff
- **HR Services**: Hired Lemma Consulting for HR services
- **Contractor Compensation**: These services are reported in the "Total number of independent contractors who received more than $100,000 of compensation from the organization = 23" category
- **Cost Attribution**: While AMG acquisition is a significant factor, increased operating expenses also reflect strategic investments in financial management, HR services, and other professional services to support organizational growth

### Revenue Streams Analysis
- **Program Services** (primary revenue): Membership dues, meetings, education, project management
- **Contributions & Grants**: Primarily government funding
- **Investment Income**: Market-dependent returns
- **Other Revenue**: Miscellaneous sources

### Expense Categories
- **Salaries & Compensation**: Regular employee costs (includes former AMG staff in 2024)
- **Officers, Directors, Trustees, Key Employees & Highest Compensated Employees**: Executive and key personnel compensation (includes expanded roles post-AMG acquisition)
- **Professional Services**: External consulting and contractor fees (includes financial management services, HR services, and other professional contractors)
- **Land, Building & Equipment**: Capital and equipment costs
- **Other Operating Expenses**: Remaining operational costs, facilities, etc.
- **Management Services**: Pre-2024 external AMG services (transitioned to internal salaries in 2024)

### Contractor Compensation Reporting
- **High-Value Contractors**: Services from contractors receiving >$100,000 are reported in the "Total number of independent contractors who received more than $100,000 of compensation from the organization = 23" category
- **Includes**: Financial management services (CFO/controller, 1.5 FTE accountants), HR services (Lemma Consulting), and other professional services
- **Cost Attribution**: These represent strategic investments in organizational capacity, not just AMG acquisition-related costs

## 2025+ HL7 Strategic Vision: Revenue Diversification Strategies

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensuring new offerings align with HL7's strategic goals and mission
- **Innovation Pipeline**: Creating structured processes for evaluating and implementing new revenue opportunities

### External Funding and Strategic Opportunities

- **Capability Building**: Developing processes for successful capture, including pipeline management, proposal development, and partnership strategies
- **Strategic Opportunity Management**: Reducing instances where strategic opportunities are missed due to inability to capture them
- **Structured Approach**: Developing systematic methods to secure strategic work

### Strategic Impact
By focusing on these diversification strategies, HL7 intends to:
- **Strengthen Financial Foundation**: Enable growth and innovation while reducing reliance on membership dues
