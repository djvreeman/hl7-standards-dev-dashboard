# HL7 International Financial Analysis - 2024

## Critical Financial Concerns

### Sustained Operating Losses Threatening Financial Stability
- **Specific Issue**: HL7 has experienced consecutive years of significant operating losses, with a net loss of $2,460,610 in 2023 and $1,449,351 in 2024. These losses total $3,909,961 over two years, representing a 36% decline in net assets from the peak of $10,659,615 in 2021 to $8,345,061 in 2024.
- **Impact**: Net assets have decreased by $2,314,554 (21.7%) since 2021. At the current burn rate, the organization could deplete its reserves within 5-6 years if losses continue.
- **Trend**: After years of healthy surpluses (2018-2021 averaged $1,420,379 annually), the organization shifted to deficits in 2023-2024, averaging $1,954,981 in annual losses.

### Declining Program Service Revenue Despite Mission-Critical Work
- **Specific Issue**: Program service revenue (core operations) has declined from $7,462,488 in 2022 to $6,487,718 in 2023 and $6,634,380 in 2024. This represents a 13% decline from 2022 levels, with revenue essentially flat between 2023-2024 despite inflation and expansion efforts.
- **Impact**: The decline of $828,108 in program revenue from 2022 to 2024 represents lost capacity to fund operations. When adjusted for inflation (approximately 7-8% over this period), real program revenue has declined by roughly 18-20%.
- **Trend**: Program service revenue peaked in 2018 at $8,474,532 and has never recovered to those levels. The 2024 figure of $6,634,380 is 22% below the 2018 peak.

### Membership Dues Stagnation Creates Strategic Vulnerability
- **Specific Issue**: Membership dues revenue has remained essentially flat since 2019, ranging between $3.0-3.6M annually. In 2024, dues were $3,065,031, representing only a 2% nominal increase from 2019's $3,247,705, which is actually a 15-20% decline in real terms when adjusted for inflation.
- **Impact**: Membership dues represented 46% of program service revenue in 2024, making the organization heavily dependent on a stagnant revenue stream. This creates significant risk as HL7's 2025+ strategic vision explicitly calls for reducing membership dues reliance.
- **Trend**: Since the April 2013 decision to make standards freely available, membership growth has been limited. Dues grew from $2,939,437 in 2014 to $3,065,031 in 2024, representing only 4.3% total growth over 10 years (0.4% annually), far below inflation rates.

### Expense Growth Outpacing Revenue Growth
- **Specific Issue**: Total expenses increased dramatically from $9,487,523 in 2022 to $12,209,584 in 2023 (29% increase) and $11,935,114 in 2024. Meanwhile, total revenue only increased from $10,218,106 in 2022 to $10,485,763 in 2024 (2.6% growth).
- **Impact**: The expense-to-revenue ratio deteriorated from 93% in 2022 to 125% in 2023 and 114% in 2024, indicating expenses are running 14% higher than revenue. This unsustainable trajectory consumed $3.9M in reserves over two years.
- **Trend**: Post-AMG acquisition, the organization has struggled to align expenses with revenue. While the 2023 spike included one-time acquisition costs, 2024 expenses remained elevated at $11.9M against only $10.5M in revenue.

### Dramatic Salary Cost Increase Following AMG Integration
- **Specific Issue**: Salaries and compensation exploded from $1,748,486 in 2023 to $4,405,676 in 2024, a 152% increase. This represents 37% of total expenses in 2024, compared to only 14% in 2023. Employee count increased from 3 to 19 as AMG staff were brought in-house.
- **Impact**: The additional $2,657,190 in salary costs far exceeded the reduction in external management services expenses (AMG costs were approximately $3.3M in 2023 but only about $1.6M in management services line items historically). The net effect added significant cost burden.
- **Trend**: The per-employee cost in 2024 is approximately $231,877 (total salaries divided by 19 employees), which is very high and suggests senior-level positions or the inclusion of significant benefits and overhead in this line item.

### Education and Certification Revenue Decline
- **Specific Issue**: Education and certification revenue decreased from $1,573,888 in 2022 to $1,367,615 in 2023 and $1,223,801 in 2024. This represents a 22% decline over two years.
- **Impact**: The loss of $350,087 in education revenue represents missed opportunities for mission-aligned revenue generation. This revenue stream had grown consistently from 2014-2022 but is now contracting.
- **Trend**: After reaching a peak of $1,573,888 in 2022, education revenue has declined for two consecutive years. This is concerning as education and certification should be growth areas aligned with HL7's strategic vision for non-membership revenue.

### Limited Progress on Alternative Revenue Streams
- **Specific Issue**: Project management fees remain modest at $349,300 in 2024 (only 5.3% of program revenue), declining from $429,821 in 2023. Despite HL7's strategic focus on revenue diversification, alternative revenue streams beyond membership and conferences remain underdeveloped.
- **Impact**: The organization remains 46% dependent on membership dues and 75% dependent on just two revenue streams (membership + conferences). This concentration creates vulnerability and contradicts the stated 2025+ strategic goal of diversification.
- **Trend**: Project management fees were introduced in 2019 but have not scaled significantly, ranging between $236K-$430K annually. No substantial new revenue streams have been developed since 2019 despite strategic goals.

### Contributions and Grants Dependency Risk
- **Specific Issue**: Contributions and grants revenue has grown from essentially $0 in 2014-2018 to $2,960,019 in 2024 (28% of total revenue). While positive, this creates dependency on external funding that may not be sustainable long-term.
- **Impact**: The organization now relies on contributions for nearly 28% of revenue. If this funding were reduced or eliminated, the existing operating deficit would more than double. This dependency conflicts with building sustainable, self-generated revenue streams.
- **Trend**: Grant funding appeared suddenly in 2019 at $1,517,454 and has grown consistently to $2,960,019 in 2024. While grants have sustained operations during the transition period, they represent external dependency rather than sustainable business model development.

## Positive Developments

### Strong Investment Performance Providing Buffer
- **Achievement**: Investment income surged to $623,483 in 2024, representing a 122% increase from 2023's $280,250 and the highest investment income in the organization's recent history.
- **Growth**: Investment returns have averaged $199,925 annually from 2014-2024. The 2024 performance of $623,483 is 212% above this average, likely reflecting strong market performance.
- **Comparison**: This represents a significant bright spot, as investment income now contributes 5.9% of total revenue, up from 2.9% in 2023. This performance partially offset operating losses and demonstrates effective asset management.

### Meetings and Conferences Revenue Resilience
- **Achievement**: Meetings and conferences revenue recovered to $1,888,048 in 2024, showing 12% growth from 2023's $1,689,359 and approaching the 2022 level of $1,916,903. This represents successful post-pandemic recovery.
- **Growth**: Conference revenue has grown 788% from the 2014 baseline of $842,285, demonstrating strong long-term demand for HL7's convening power and thought leadership.
- **Comparison**: The 2024 figure represents the second-highest conference revenue on record (after 2019's exceptional $2,698,811), indicating robust member and stakeholder engagement despite challenging economic conditions.

### Maintained Asset Base Despite Operating Losses
- **Achievement**: Despite two years of significant operating losses totaling $3.9M, HL7 maintained net assets of $8,345,061 at year-end 2024. This represents a substantial financial cushion equivalent to approximately 8.4 months of operating expenses.
- **Growth**: Net assets have grown 110% from $3,978,658 in 2014 to $8,345,061 in 2024, demonstrating successful long-term asset building despite recent challenges.
- **Comparison**: While down from the 2021 peak of $10,659,615, current reserves remain healthy and provide runway for strategic transformation and investment in growth initiatives.

### Successful Post-Pandemic Revenue Recovery
- **Achievement**: Total revenue recovered to $10,485,763 in 2024, representing 7.6% growth from 2023 and exceeding the 2022 pre-integration level. This demonstrates organizational resilience.
- **Growth**: Revenue grew by $736,789 year-over-year from 2023 to 2024, driven by increases in conferences (+$198,689), membership (+$64,108), contributions (+$161,796), and especially investment income (+$343,233).
- **Comparison**: 2024 revenue of $10.5M represents the second-highest total on record, trailing only 2022. The organization has successfully grown revenue by 108% from 2014 levels ($5.0M to $10.5M).

### Growing Contributions Base Demonstrates Mission Alignment
- **Achievement**: Contributions and grants reached $2,960,019 in 2024, the highest level recorded and 5.8% above 2023's $2,798,223. This demonstrates strong external validation of HL7's mission and work.
- **Growth**: Grant revenue has grown from zero in 2014-2018 to nearly $3M annually, representing successful development of government and foundation relationships. This 5.8% year-over-year growth shows continued momentum.
- **Comparison**: The organization has successfully diversified revenue by developing a $3M+ grant portfolio that didn't exist prior to 2019, representing genuine progress in reducing membership-only dependency.

### Strategic Investment in Leadership and Capacity
- **Achievement**: The expansion from 3 to 19 employees in 2024, following the AMG integration and 2022 executive hires, represents strategic investment in organizational capacity to pursue growth initiatives and revenue diversification.
- **Growth**: The organization has moved from essentially consultant-based operations (0-3 employees from 2015-2023) to a substantive staff structure capable of executing complex strategic initiatives.
- **Comparison**: With senior leadership in place (Chief Standards Development Officer, Chief Standards Implementation Officer, Deputy Chief Standards Implementation Officer) and expanded staff, HL7 now has the infrastructure needed to pursue its 2025+ strategic vision for new markets, partnerships, and external funding.

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Cost Optimization and Expense Realignment
**Urgency: Critical - Address within 90 days**

HL7 must immediately reduce the expense base to eliminate operating losses and preserve reserves for strategic investment. Specific actions include:

- **Conduct zero-based budgeting review**: Evaluate every expense line against strategic priorities and revenue generation potential. Target 15-20% expense reduction ($1.8-2.4M) to return to break-even operations.
- **Optimize post-AMG staffing structure**: With salary costs now at $4.4M (37% of expenses), analyze whether all 19 positions drive revenue or strategic value. Consider whether some functions could be more cost-effectively delivered through contractors or shared services.
- **Implement program-level P&L analysis**: Establish profit/loss tracking for each major program (conferences, education, certification, project management) to identify underperforming activities that consume resources without adequate return.
- **Rationalize facilities and overhead**: Review "other expenses" of $7.5M to identify discretionary spending that can be reduced without impacting core mission delivery.

**Success metric**: Return to operational break-even (expenses ≤ revenue) within 12 months, targeting $9.5-10M expense base against projected $10.5-11M revenue.

### 2. Accelerate Revenue Diversification Beyond Membership Model
**Urgency: High - Launch initiatives within 6 months**

The stagnation of membership dues at $3M annually, combined with the 2013 strategic decision to make standards freely available, requires aggressive development of alternative revenue streams:

- **Scale project management and consulting services**: Current project fees of $349K represent only 5% of revenue despite clear market need for HL7 implementation support. Target 3x growth to $1M+ annually by systematically marketing implementation services, project oversight, and technical advisory services to health systems and vendors.
- **Develop premium education and certification programs**: Reverse the 22% decline in education revenue by creating tiered offerings including: advanced certification programs ($500-2,000 per participant), corporate training packages ($10,000-50,000 per organization), and online learning platforms with subscription models ($200-500 annually).
- **Commercialize intellectual property and tools**: Develop revenue-generating tools, reference implementations, testing platforms, and conformance services that add value beyond free standards access. Target $500K-1M in new IP-based revenue.
- **Establish strategic partnership revenue model**: Formalize vendor partnership programs with tiered sponsorship and collaboration opportunities beyond conference sponsorship. Target $750K-1M in partnership revenue.
- **Create global licensing and localization services**: Offer paid services for standards localization, regional implementation support, and country-specific customization. Target international markets with $500K+ revenue potential.

**Success metric**: Reduce membership dues to <35% of total revenue (from current 29%) while growing non-dues program revenue from $3.6M to $5M+ within 24 months.

### 3. Transform Conferences into Year-Round Revenue Engine
**Urgency: Medium - Implement within 12 months**

Meetings and conferences revenue of $1.9M represents an underutilized asset that could generate substantially more value:

- **Develop virtual and hybrid event portfolio**: Create quarterly virtual events ($25,000-50,000 revenue each) to supplement annual conferences, generating $100K-200K in incremental revenue while building year-round engagement.
- **Expand international and regional events**: Launch regional HL7 symposiums in high-growth markets (Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Latin America) with lower cost structures but similar revenue potential ($200K-300K per event).
- **Enhance conference monetization**: Increase per-attendee revenue through premium workshops ($500-1,000), certification testing on-site ($300-500), and expanded exhibition opportunities. Target 25% revenue increase from existing attendance.
- **Create corporate event partnerships**: Offer organizations the opportunity to co-host specialized events, bringing their networks while generating $50K-100K per partnership.

**Success metric**: Grow conferences and events revenue from $1.9M to $2.5M+ annually while maintaining healthy 40%+ profit margins.

### 4. Build Systematic External Funding Capture Capability
**Urgency: High - Establish within 6 months**

With $3M in contributions demonstrating external validation, HL7 should professionalize grant and funding acquisition:

- **Establish dedicated funding development function**: Create a business development/grants management role (potentially combined with partnership development) to systematically identify, pursue, and manage government contracts, foundation grants, and research funding.
- **Develop opportunity pipeline management**: Implement systematic scanning of federal funding opportunities (NIH, ONC, AHRQ, CDC), international development organizations (WHO, World Bank), and major foundations. Target 15-20 qualified opportunities annually.
- **Build proposal development infrastructure**: Create reusable proposal content library, capability statements, past performance documentation, and partnership frameworks to respond quickly to opportunities. Reduce proposal development time by 50%.
- **Grow contract base to $4-5M annually**: While maintaining $3M in grants, add $1-2M in government contracts for standards development, implementation support, and technical assistance where HL7 expertise creates competitive advantage.
- **Establish strategic opportunity governance**: Create executive-level review process to evaluate strategic fit of opportunities and ensure the organization only pursues funding aligned with mission and capacity.

**Success metric**: Increase external funding from $3M to $4.5-5M annually while maintaining alignment with core mission and avoiding resource-intensive, low-margin contracts.

### 5. Revitalize Membership Value Proposition Post-Free Standards
**Urgency: Medium - Launch within 9 months**

The 2013 decision to make standards freely available fundamentally changed membership value, requiring a reimagined model:

- **Reframe membership around community and impact**: Position membership as joining a mission-driven community advancing health interoperability, not purchasing standards access. Emphasize professional network, influence on standards direction, and collective impact.
- **Create tiered membership benefits**: Develop platinum/gold/silver organizational tiers with differentiated benefits including: premium support services, early access to emerging standards, dedicated technical advisory time, co-marketing opportunities, and strategic advisory board participation.
- **Add member-exclusive services**: Provide premium benefits such as: unlimited certification exam attempts, free attendance at virtual events, access to implementation guides and toolkits, members-only networking platform, and quarterly executive briefings on standards direction.
- **Target modest growth**: Stabilize membership at current levels while improving retention (target 90%+ retention rate), then pursue 5-10% annual growth focused on high-value organizational members at premium tiers.
- **Develop member success program**: Assign relationship managers to top 50 organizational members (representing likely 60-70% of dues revenue) to ensure satisfaction, maximize engagement, and prevent attrition.

**Success metric**: Grow membership dues from $3.1M to $3.5M within 24 months while improving retention from estimated 75-80% to 90%+, and achieve 40% of membership at premium tiers.

### 6. Implement Rigorous Financial Management and Monitoring
**Urgency: Critical - Implement immediately**

The deterioration from consistent surpluses to sustained losses requires enhanced financial discipline:

- **Establish monthly management reporting**: Implement dashboard tracking revenue by source, expenses by category, cash position, and runway analysis. Review monthly at executive leadership level with quarterly board review.
- **Create rolling 12-month cash flow forecasting**: Project cash needs and revenue timing to ensure adequate liquidity and avoid surprises. Particularly important given uneven conference and membership renewal cycles.
- **Set expense approval thresholds**: Require CFO or CEO approval for expenses above specific thresholds ($10K-25K) to prevent budget overruns and ensure strategic alignment of spending.
- **Implement program-level financial accountability**: Assign P&L responsibility for major programs (conferences, education, projects) with clear revenue targets and expense budgets. Create accountability for financial performance.
- **Establish reserve protection policy**: Formalize minimum reserve requirements (e.g., 6 months operating expenses) and define circumstances under which reserves can be used versus must be rebuilt.
- **Develop 3-year financial plan**: Create realistic financial projections tied to strategic initiatives, showing path to sustainable operations and appropriate reserve levels.

**Success metric**: Achieve 100% accuracy in monthly financial reporting within 60 days, return to positive net income within 12 months, and rebuild reserves to $10M within 36 months.

### 7. Launch New Market Innovation Pipeline
**Urgency: Medium - Establish within 12 months**

HL7's 2025+ strategic vision calls for incubating new revenue ideas, requiring systematic innovation:

- **Create innovation council**: Establish cross-functional team (staff, board members, key members) to evaluate new revenue opportunities quarterly. Use stage-gate process to advance ideas from concept to pilot to scale.
- **Allocate innovation investment fund**: Dedicate $250K-500K annually (2.5-5% of revenue) specifically for piloting new offerings, with clear ROI expectations and go/no-go decision points.
- **Develop rapid piloting methodology**: Create 90-day pilot framework allowing quick testing of new services, products, or partnerships with minimal investment before full commitment.
- **Priority innovation areas**: Focus initial efforts on: (1) AI-powered standards implementation tools, (2) automated conformance testing services, (3) standards-as-a-service for emerging markets, (4) health data exchange consulting, and (5) certification body licensing model.
- **Establish partnership exploration process**: Systematically identify and evaluate potential strategic partners (technology vendors, consulting firms, academic institutions) who could co-develop and co-market new offerings.

**Success metric**: Launch 3-4 pilot initiatives annually with target of 1-2 scaling to $250K+ revenue within 24 months. Generate $500K-1M from new offerings by end of year 3.

### 8. Address Structural Cost of Integrated AMG Operations
**Urgency: High - Evaluate within 6 months**

The AMG integration added $2.7M in salary costs that may not be sustainable at current revenue levels:

- **Conduct AMG integration value analysis**: Rigorously evaluate whether bringing AMG in-house improved service quality, operational efficiency, or strategic capability sufficient to justify the cost increase. Compare current performance and satisfaction to pre-integration baseline.
- **Benchmark staffing model**: Compare HL7's staffing levels and costs to peer organizations (IEEE, ASTM, other standards bodies) to determine if current structure is appropriate for organization size and mission.
- **Consider hybrid operating model**: Evaluate whether some functions currently performed in-house could be more cost-effectively delivered through contractors, shared services, or partnerships. This might include: IT services, event management, marketing, or administrative functions.
- **Evaluate headquarters and facilities strategy**: Determine optimal balance of office space, remote work, and distributed teams to minimize overhead while maintaining collaboration and culture.
- **Right-size for sustainable operations**: Make difficult but necessary decisions to align staff capacity with realistic revenue projections. Better to have smaller, sustainable operations than maintain unsustainable cost structure that depletes reserves.

**Success metric**: Reduce total operating expenses from $11.9M to $10M or below within 18 months while maintaining or improving service delivery quality. Ensure personnel costs represent no more than 30-35% of total expenses.

---

## Conclusion

HL7 International stands at a critical juncture. The organization has strong mission alignment, demonstrated by growing external funding and robust conference attendance, and maintains healthy reserves of $8.3M. However, consecutive years of operating losses totaling $3.9M, declining program service revenue, and expense growth outpacing revenue create an unsustainable trajectory.

The fundamental challenge stems from the 2013 strategic decision to make standards freely available, which was mission-aligned but eliminated the core transactional value of membership. A decade later, the organization has not yet successfully replaced this with alternative revenue models at scale. Membership dues remain flat in nominal terms (declining in real terms), while alternative revenue streams like project management and education remain underdeveloped despite clear market opportunity.

The AMG integration in 2023-2024, while potentially strategically sound, significantly increased the cost structure at precisely the wrong time. Salary costs jumped from $1.7M to $4.4M, contributing to the expense-revenue imbalance that consumed reserves.

**The path forward requires decisive action in three areas:**

1. **Immediate financial stabilization**: Reduce expenses by 15-20% to return to break-even operations and preserve reserves for strategic investment rather than operational losses.

2. **Aggressive revenue diversification**: Scale existing alternative revenue streams (project management, education, partnerships) from current $1-2M to $4-5M+ annually, while launching new offerings through systematic innovation.

3. **Enhanced execution capability**: Implement rigorous financial management, program-level accountability, and systematic business development to ensure the organization can effectively pursue its strategic vision.

HL7's mission remains critically important to healthcare interoperability, and the organization has the reserves, market position, and strategic clarity to succeed. However, success requires urgently addressing the structural financial challenges while simultaneously investing in growth. The organization has perhaps 2-3 years of runway at current burn rates to complete this transformation before reserve depletion forces more dramatic interventions.

The time to act is now.
